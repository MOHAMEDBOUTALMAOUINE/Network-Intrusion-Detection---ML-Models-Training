# 🚀 Network Intrusion Detection - ML Models Training

---

## 📚 Project Overview

This project focuses on building, training, and evaluating **Machine Learning models** for **Network Intrusion Detection** using the well-known `CICIDS2017` dataset. The main goal is to automatically detect and classify network traffic as benign or malicious based on flow-based features.

The project includes:
- 📊 Data preprocessing  
- ⚙️ Training different machine learning models  
- 🧪 Performance evaluation  
- 📈 Visual comparison of algorithms
